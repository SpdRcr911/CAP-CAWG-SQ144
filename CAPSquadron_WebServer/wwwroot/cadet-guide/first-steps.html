    </div> <h1>Welcome to San Diego Cadet Squadron 144</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Civil Air Patrol&#39;s San Diego Cadet Squadron 144 &ndash; a place where today&#39;s cadets are trained to be tomorrow&#39;s aerospace leaders. We are thrilled to have you on board and can&#39;t wait to see your achievements!</p>

    <h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>

    <p>To begin, we recommend making three visits to our squadron to understand our activities and ethos. During your second visit, we&#39;ll arrange a meeting with our squadron staff to discuss your goals and how we can work together effectively.</p>

    <h2><strong>Second Visit: Required Documentation</strong></h2>

    <p>On your second visit, we ask you to present identification documents. The simplest option is: <strong>U.S. Passport or U.S. Passport Card</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Alternative Documents:</strong> If you don&#39;t have a passport, you can provide one document from each of the following two groups:</p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li><strong>Photo ID:</strong> Examples include a State-issued Driver&rsquo;s License or ID, School ID Card, or U.S. Military ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Legal Status:</strong> Examples include a Social Security Card, Birth Certificate, or Native American Tribal Document.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please bring these documents for verification purposes. If you need more information or if you have other forms of identification, feel free to contact us for guidance.
