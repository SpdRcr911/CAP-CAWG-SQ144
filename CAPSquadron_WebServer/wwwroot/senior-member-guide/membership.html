    <h2>Senior Membership</h2>

    <p>Senior membership in CAP is a privilege for those individuals who are 18 years of age or older and conscientiously desire to promote the objectives and purposes of CAP and who meet the eligibility requirements. See CAPR 39-2 for specific eligibility requirements for senior member enrollment. The following describes the basic senior member categories:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>An active senior member</strong> regularly attends meetings, performs a specific duty assignment, meets training requirements, and participates in the activities of his or her unit.</li>
        <li><strong>A patron member</strong> is a financial supporter who maintains current membership through payment of annual membership dues and participates in a limited capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>A retired member</strong> is a member in good standing with a minimum of 20 years of service as a senior member, not necessarily continuous, who has submitted a CAPF 2a requesting his or her status be changed to that of retired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cadet Sponsor Membership</h2>

    <p>Cadet Sponsor Member (CSM) is a membership category established to allow parents, grandparents, and guardians of current CAP cadets to assist their unit&#39;s cadet program by providing adult supervision, transportation, overnight chaperons, and any other cadet-related tasks deemed necessary and proper by the unit commander. CSMs must complete all portions of Level I Training before participating in any activities. These members are a good source of manpower to small units. It is also a good way to get a parent involved before becoming an active member.</p>

    <h2>Steps to Senior Membership</h2>

        <li>Fill out and print the membership application</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Training</h2>

    <p>Once you join as a member, you will have some online training to complete. Level 1 is required for active members. All members are required to complete monthly and annual safety. If you are absent during monthly safety training, you will go online to complete one course to stay current.</p>
