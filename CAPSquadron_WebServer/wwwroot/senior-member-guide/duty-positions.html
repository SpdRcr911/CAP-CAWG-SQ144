    <p>1. Instructional Duties.&nbsp;The cyber education officer is an instructor and subject matter expert. He or she should be a resource to the unit on all cybersecurity related topics covered in cadet aerospace education texts.</p>

    <p>2. Cyber Activities.&nbsp;Cyber education officers organize and local activities such as tours of industry sites having a significant presence in the cyber domain. Further, they promote cyber activities conducted above squadron level and steer cadets who are interested in cyber toward cyber-related National Cadet Special Activities.</p>

    <p>3. Cyber Competitions.&nbsp;The cyber education officer serves as the coach of squadron-level teams at Cyber Patriot (or similar competition programs). Squadron-level officers should coordinate with their wing-level counterparts if starting a new team from scratch, and to track unit participation in the program.</p>

    <p>4. Program Leadership.&nbsp;Because the cyber domain is new to CAP, cyber education officers are needed to take a leadership role in growing the program. They assist the unit in identifying solutions to existing or emerging problems and opportunities in the area of cyber programs and liaise with the wing cyber programs officer on execution. A highly successful cyber education officer will create a plan of action for the squadron&rsquo;s cyber programs and activities annually.</p>

    <p>A role filled by all senior members:</p>

    <p>1. Background</p>

    <p>Thanks to funding provided by the Air Force Surgeon General&rsquo;s office, CAP operated a Drug Demand Reduction (DDR) program for many years, inspiring thousands of our cadets to be drug-free leaders in their communities. Requirements for the program changed a few years ago and this caused CAP to completely rethink how best to conduct DDR. This letter will outline how DDR will be incorporated into the cadet program.</p>

    <p>2. The Future of Cadet Character Development &amp; Drug-Free Messaging</p>

    <p>With the termination of specially-designated DDR funding, we no longer need to isolate &ldquo;DDR&rdquo; as a stand-alone program, nor maintain a separate regulation for DDR activities. Of course, the effort to motivate cadets to adopt a drug-free lifestyle endures. We now have an opportunity to integrate our drug-free message into all facets of cadet life. Our best DDR officers have achieved success because they integrated drug-free content into nearly everything cadets do, rather than separating those learning opportunities from the ordinary cadet experience. Therefore, we will continue to develop in cadets skills for making smart, responsible choices, and to challenge them to serve as ambassadors of our Core Values and a drug-free ethic in their schools and communities.</p>

    <p>3. A New, Integrated Goal Statement</p>

    <p>Accordingly, the cadet program management regulation now highlights drug-free programming as an important comp- onent of cadet character education, instead of treating that content area as a separate program called DDR governed by its own regulation. The new goal statement for cadet character education reads:&nbsp;&ldquo;To develop in cadets an ability to think critically about moral and ethical issues and to develop a commitment to live CAP&rsquo;s Core Values . . . .Three topics receive special emphasis in the character element [including that] CAP challenges cadets to become ambassadors of a drug-free ethic . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;CAPR 60-1,&nbsp;Cadet Program Management&nbsp;(1 February 2018), section 1.9.4.</p>

        <a id="Fitness Officer" name="Fitness Officer">Fitness Officer</a>
    </h4>

    <p>Key Duties &amp; Best Practices:</p>

    <p>1. Teach &amp; Inspire Cadets.&nbsp;The FEO shares his or her enthusiasm for fitness and nutrition, acting as a class- room teacher or activity leader. By teaching cadets about healthy lifestyles and exposing them to different sports, games and exercises the FEO aims to support lifelong healthy and physical activity.</p>

    <p>2. Manage the Fitness Program. Units are required to offer at least one hour of fitness programing each month, with most of the time spent doing moderate to vigorous physical activity. Cadet NCOs should lead the majority of the cadet fitness activities and classes. The FEO will set the standards for the fitness program and help coach the NCOs to be as hands-on as possible with their experience level. The FEO should require new NCOs to provide a detailed outline before they teach a class and demonstrate a strong understanding of the fitness activity before they lead it. As cadets gain more experience they&rsquo;ll need less direct oversight, but the FEO remains the person responsible for ensuring the fitness program is delivered appropriately to cadets.</p>

    <p>3. Mentor Cadets.&nbsp;Every cadet will have different fitness goals. The FEO will help cadets set their fitness goals appropriately and create their plans to reach them. Encourage cadets to use the S.M.A.R.T. goal setting process (see CAPP 60-31,&nbsp;Cadet Staff Handbook) and track their progress. FEOs will encourage the discussion of fitness goals during leadership feedback meetings and promotion review board. Note that the process of setting the goal and working diligently to attain it is more important than whether the goal is met. The FEO will help to recognize cadets&rsquo; fitness achievements and encourage those who are struggling.</p>

    <p>4. Lead Outreach Activities. The FEO will look beyond the squadron into the local community and wing. Encourage squadron participation in local fitness events, such as bike races or fun runs. The squadron might also volunteer to work at these events, assisting with parking, water stops, etc. to support fitness in their local community. The FEO may also help to organize wing or group cadet fitness events, such as a Wing Ironman challenge or Cadet Olympics.</p>

    <p>5. Conduct Fitness Assessments.&nbsp;Conduct the CPFT fitness assessment quarterly, or more frequently as necessary, to assist cadets in measuring their fitness. The FEO will be familiar with the testing protocols of CAPP 60-50 and instruct cadets how to perform the exercises. After the assessment, the FEO will ensure that the cadets&rsquo; results are recorded in eServices.</p>
